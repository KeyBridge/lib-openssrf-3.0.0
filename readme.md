# OpenSSRF Reference Implementation Software
## V3.0.0r00 (Release)

OpenSSRF is an open source reference implementation of the Standard Spectrum Resource 
Format (SSRF). The specification is defined in MCEB Pub 8. 

## SSRF v3.0 is Superceded by v3.1.0
This software library is NOT ACTIVELY DEVELOPED.

Bug fixes made in the v3.1.0 code base, especially in the SSRFProperties and 
SSRFUtilities classes, will be backwards ported. However there is no intention 
to backwards port automated features, utilities or other improvements 
implemented in the v.3.1.0 library.

## Background
This software library is a release of the OpenSSRF project, whose goal is to develop and
publish a complete and certifiably compliant reference implementation of the 
Standard Spectrum Resource Format (version 3.x) into Java.

This software library is provided to facilitate system and service migration 
from SSRF v3.0 to 3.1 and, where migration is not possible, to support 
interoperability.

See the [tutorial](tutorial.md) for a brief how-to.

## In this Release
The software contained in this release is, to the best of our knowledge, a complete
and compliant implementation of the SSRF v3.0 data format specification. 

Special attention and effort has been invested to organize the software, to improve the approachability of the
underlying SSRF logical data model, and to add methods and techniques to simplify 
the construction of SSRF data structures.

## Background of this Project
In 2013 Key Bridge approached officials at the DoD to use SSRF on a license-free, commercial basis and,
upon receiving positive response, collaborated with the Wireless Innovation Forum to initiate 
a joint Government-Industry work group to develop and publish an open source, license-free reference 
implementation of the most recent SSRF specification. 

This project is managed by the Open Standard Spectrum Resource Format (SSRF) group and organized
by the Wireless Innovation Forum's [Spectrum Innovation Committee](http://groups.winnforum.org/spectrum_innovation_committee).

## Availability and Use
The source code and documentation within this project are available under the Apache 2.0 license, copies of which are
included in the source tree and documentation directories.

You are free to download, use and modify this project without restriction, subject to the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.

## Give Back
Your code and contributions are welcome. There are two ways you can give back and help improve and perfect this reference implementation.

 1. Join the Wireless Innovation Forum. By joining the Forum you gain formal and informal access to a large community of like-minded companies, government agencies and individuals working together for a common goal. Forum members may also participate in the architecture committee of this software project and also influence future development and improvement of the SSRF specification.
 2. Contribute software. Anyone can fork the code and submit your updates, fixes, utilities and other contributions directly to Key Bridge. We will review and incorporate anything that is helpful.
